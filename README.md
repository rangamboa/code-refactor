# code-refactor

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to optimize CSS rulesets and HTML markup to "clean up" the work and make it more accessible for future reference.

## Process

In order to fulfill the task, style rulesets were defined universally, for the body, and for specific tags. Redundant rules were consolidated where possible.
